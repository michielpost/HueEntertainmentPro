# Hue Entertainment Pro
Old name: Hue Light DJ

[![Build .NET](https://github.com/michielpost/HueLightDJ/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/michielpost/HueLightDJ/actions/workflows/build.yml)

# LIVE DEMO

Click Start under Demo Group, then click Connect  
DEMO:  [https://huelightdj.azurewebsites.net/](https://huelightdj.azurewebsites.net/)

## What is it?
This web app connects to a Philips Hue Bridge over the local network. It uses the Hue Entertainment API to update the lights almost instantly.
Hue Light DJ is meant for setups with 20+ Hue Lights. You can also use this for your personal setup with less than 5 lights, but things get interesting with 10+ lights, you can try it out. There is also a DEMO mode build in so you see how it would look like on a 20+ light setup.

NOTE: [Hue Entertainment](https://developers.meethue.com/entertainment-blog) supports max 20 lights in an Entertainment Group using the v2 API. To get this to work with more than 20 addressable lights, you need to have 1 bridge for every 20 lights. A led strip contains more than 1 addressable light (for example 3 or 5).

### Demo with 32 Hue Light Strips on 5 bridges
