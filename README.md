# Hue Entertainment Pro
Old name: Hue Light DJ

[![Build .NET](https://github.com/michielpost/HueLightDJ/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/michielpost/HueLightDJ/actions/workflows/build.yml)

## What is it?
This web app can connect to multiple Philips Hue Bridges over the local network. It uses the Hue Entertainment API to update the lights almost instantly.

**Hue Entertainment Pro** is designed for setups with **multiple Philips Hue bridges**, allowing you to merge several entertainment areas into one seamless experience.

- Perfect for **large setups** with 20+ Hue lights  
- Works with **smaller setups** too (even under 5 lights)  
- Things get really fun once you pass **10+ lights** â€” give it a try  
- Includes a built-in **DEMO mode**, so you can preview how a 20+ light setup would look, even if you have fewer lights at home
- Includes a top down preview and a **new 3D preview**
- Hue Event Monitor to easily monitor events from your bridges
- Resource Explorer to view all data on your Hue Bridge

NOTE: The original [Hue Entertainment API](https://developers.meethue.com/entertainment-blog) supports max 20 lights in an Entertainment Group using the v2 API. To get this to work with more than 20 addressable lights, you need to have 1 bridge for every 20 lights. A led strip contains more than 1 addressable light (for example 3 or 5).
Using Hue Entertainment Pro, you can merge these areas into one area to apply effects to.

## Live Demo
NOTE: You can't use this demo to connect to your own bridge. But you can use the two included Demo Areas to view a simulation.
